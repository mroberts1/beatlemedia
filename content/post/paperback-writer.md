Paperback writer (paperback writer)  
Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?  
It took me years to write, will you take a look?  
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear  
And I need a job  
So I wanna be a paperback writer  
Paperback writer  
  
It's a dirty story of a dirty man  
And his clinging wife doesn't understand  
His son is working for the Daily Mail  
It's a steady job  
But he wants to be a paperback writer  
Paperback writer  
Paperback writer (paperback writer) 
  
It's a thousand pages, give or take a few  
I'll be writing more in a week or two  
I could make it longer if you like the style  
I can change it 'round  
And I wanna be a paperback writer  
Paperback writer  
  
If you really like it you can have the rights  
It could make a million for you overnight  
If you must return it you can send it here  
But I need a break  
And I wanna be a paperback writer  
Paperback writer  
  
Paperback writer (paperback writer)  
Paperback writer (paperback writer)  
Paperback writer (paperback writer)  
Paperback writer (paperback writer)  
Paperback writer (paperback writer)
